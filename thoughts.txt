LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL : Very low MAPE ==> 0.24% (too low?)

ARIMA MODEL (Time-series analysis) : linear rising trend (wrong?) use automatic arima tuning with auto_arima for d,p,q 
d > 1 leads to over-differencing
Seasonal = true, stepwise = true (does all possible combinations), trace = true (prints all in command)
can make lower MAPE with d = 3, but this is because it destroys certain information from the data
so best arima paremeters are (0,1,0) according to auto_arima

Since statsmodels library is not on the list, we need to rewrite the arima model using only allowed libraries
The ARIMA modeling will be implemented from scratch, using the Box-Jenkins methodology.
This includes differencing for stationarity and solving AR/MA coefficients manually.

Sequence length = 80 : {

With EPOCH 100 : 
Learning rate 0.001 ==> MAPE 7.47%
Learning rate 0.01 ==> MAPE 4.97%
Learning rate 0.02 ==> MAPE 4.35%
Learning rate 0.05 ==> MAPE 2.96%
Learning rate 0.07 ==> MAPE 5.99%
Learning rate 0.10 ==> MAPE 6.42%

With EPOCH 357 : 
Learning rate 0.001 ==> MAPE 5.09%
Learning rate 0.01 ==> MAPE 4.36%
Learning rate 0.02 ==> MAPE 3.00%
Learning rate 0.05 ==> MAPE 4.27%

Sequence length 30 : bad results, not enough for 5 years of data
Sequence length 60 : bad results
Sequence length 90 : bad results
